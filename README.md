# Okey65 ortholinear keyboard
### _65 keys ortholinear keyboard using a qwerty based symetric layout_
 
The goal of this project is to design a more complete version of my hand-wired keyboard that I have been using for several years.  
The keyboard has a well-balanced size that allows it to be quite compact while still having all the important keys available on the main layer.  
Its layout is quite atypical but very convenient for typing text with accented Latin characters.  
It is based on an Atmega32u4 chip and the QMK firmware is compiled and editable at kbfirmware.com. The switch footprints are 5-pins MX type.  
The design is minimalist, not including a backlight, but modern, the pcb has no screws and is fully dampened by EVA foam.  
However, not being an electronics professional and this project being my first one, the switches are not hot-swappable as integrating this feature made the design too complex for my skill level.  
Known issue: Indicator LEDs for lock keys do not work.
